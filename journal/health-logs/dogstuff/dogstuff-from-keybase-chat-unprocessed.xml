The following post will have details on my measurement tooling. I will edit it to reflect my hardware, so replies can have details on what I used. Future tooling will have a new entry referencing this one. The hope is to create a chain so all measurements can be tied to a method. Not every line will be tied to it.

[measurement tooling] TBA
Good morning. I woke up around 12:30pm.
I slept ok.

I have a slight headache.

Had to get out of bed to grab measurement tools so the readings will be off.

Body temp: 98.7 F
SPO2: %O2 97; BPM 98
Acetoacetate: less than 5mg/ml

Had to poop.
Bathroom details will follow.

Food notes:
My body temp hasn't dropped below 98 F which is also odd. I think this may simply be I've been eating more reliably than normal.

I'm focusing on getting something in me in morning/night to feed the bacteria. It's easier to stay fed when I stock up (which i did to prepare).

I was eating a lot of https://www.walmart.com/ip/El-Monterey-Sausage-Egg-Potato-Cheese-Family-Size-Breakfast-Wraps-28-8-Oz-8-Ct-Frozen/52875701 for the first few days.
But now I've just switched to my standard breakfast drink in the morning. Seems to be keeping me normalized.

GF just picked up some Aldi's hamburger that I'll be doing for lunch/dinner. So that will also be on the menu for the next couple.

GF's mom made https://www.walmart.com/ip/Zatarain-s-Jambalaya-Mix-40-oz/10534993 with a kelbasa. I ate for dinner yesterday and the day before. Tasted good.

She also had https://www.walmart.com/ip/Zatarain-s-Honey-Butter-Cornbread-Mix-12-5-oz/673181538 which seemed fairly low in sugar so I ate a couple (2/12ths)
(was fairly impressed with the ingredient lists not having much bullshit in them)

I put it all in a plastic shaker I got when I ordered Huel a couple years ago. It's got a nice plastic screen that helps everything mix. https://huel.com/products/clear-shaker

I was normally using
1 scoop Anthony's Collagen Peptide Powder https://www.amazon.com/Anthonys-Collagen-Peptide-Hydrolyzed-Friendly/dp/B071S8D69C/
but we went back to the Orgain this month.

Been trying to find an oil based MCT oil, but all the bulk options stopped being sold or were too small to be cost effective with drinking it everyday.

Things are going well. No adverse effects as far as I can tell.

I feel fairly good all thins considering. I suspect it's working given I haven't had many issues health wise.

The neat thing is my left hand has gone from about 60lb to 100lb of grip strength. I think the reduction in gut inflammation is helping me nerves talk to my arm muscles. Or it could just be a fluke.

I have also noticed that I am not getting muscle spasticity symptoms or the weird inability to make a fist in the morning. The only other things that fixed these were heavy use of collagen or THC, which both target inflammatory pathways.

Given the high levels of inflammatory microbes in my feces, and how much better I feel now, I'm leaning toward it working.  Gonna be neat to test my poop after i'm done to see if it's all in my head or not.

I have had no balance issues for 5 days!

These results so far are fairly drastic. So I am expecting part of it is just being extra attentive to my diet. I'm not eating anything out of the ordinary for me.

But I am eating more cheese than normal and had a bunch of egg burritos back to back that might have contributed to higher than normal omega3 + choline. So its possible I'm just feeling fallout from that.  Tho that was 10 days ago and choline usually needs to be supplemented every 3 days for me to feel it.

Drank 3 smirnoff ice last night. No major issues.

Movies ng today has given me a headache and major blood pressure problems, but after sitting for a bit I am recovered mostly.

Have more energy than last month, but still not 100%.

The most notice able improvement is I have reliable grip strength without hand pain.
I screwed in a bed frame without issues it took a while but my head pressure gave me more problems than my hand.

Stayed up all night and eventually fell asleep at around 5pm yesterday when I got home from my dad's.  Been taking pills when I wake up, so may have gone more than 24 hours between.
Took a shower and had another pill a few minutes ago.
I hurt my back around my rib cage and shoulders after moving some heavy things with my dad. Which is why I slept so long Saturday night.

Just woke up.

I have been in a lot of pain with my neck/back so going shopping yesterday didn't work I couldn't think straight in the store. I also wasn't able to deal with a change of plans that occured during the trip over. The car ride itself was near unbearable.

My hands have been doing fine tho, which is unexpected.
Acetoacetate 0 mg/ml
Have had a stuffy nose since that night I slept so long. Only thing stopping it was the monster rehab energy drink, which I am out of

Woke up at 5:30pm ish.

Just took temp 97.5 F
Woke up with a major acid-reflux event last night (around 10am). Went in my nose. It was quite awful.

intense burning sensation and had to inhale a bit to get it out of my nose cavity.

After it stopped hurting I noticed a massive increase in mucus production.

Not sure why that happened.
Notable because i've had acid reflux before, but it never hurt and never made mucus. I wonder if it should have?

I'm still alive. I ordered my second Viome test yesterday so I should even be able to show that my health improvements are related to gut microbiota shifts (or prove it's all in my head, lol).
I'm expecting it to be largely be a function of gut inflammation related bacteria because I basically haven't had Crohn's symptoms at all since my 3rd pill.
Long term effects, if they are in fact epigenetic, will take longer to manifest, so will be harder to prove are related.
I already have a huge difference in my ability to stand and not get fatigued, and my grip strength is actually getting up to 120lbs for each arm. I haven't done a single bit of exercise, so this change is rather remarkable to me.
I'm not sure what exactly would be doing this, except just better utilization of food overall? If it's an electrical signaling phenomena related to my brain being to communicate despite demyelination, it may explain it.
I hope that is the case because higher electrical activity + reduced inflammation are the two pillars needed to rigger remyelinating provided I feed myself the right nutrients.
