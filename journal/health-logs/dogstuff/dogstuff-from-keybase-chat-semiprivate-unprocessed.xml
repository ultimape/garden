I am going to start my dog feces FMT sometime at the end of the month. Hoping to aim toward the 20th. Going to be interesting.
I could get sepsis and die.
I have been learning about how gut bacteria might help with dna repair. It makes me wonder if they can help.

Don't take too much at once
Have some antibiotics ready to treat yourself.
Have someway of measuring if it is going wrong.
"antibiotics" might include enema to flush it out. Maybe iodine enema to directly kill stuff.
Before you try it take a sample of what is currently inside you and do an invitro experiment with both together.

I've been very bad feeling lately. That weird brain state thing is happening more and more and living back with my GF in a cramped space isn't helping me keep a healthy environment.
Grumpy most of the time now and it makes me anxious to interact with anyone directly because I get angry over nothing. Some mood disorder thing tied to the multiple sclerosis.

hand strength, body composition shifts.  If i'm right about how this works, i will have improvements over a 6 month period as my body starts to trigger different epigenetic pathways.

Dog ended up getting diarhea, but we also gave her too much of that teef thing at the same time.  She was good when we stopped the teef for a bit

probably a good idea to track somethign like that via blood test.
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/at-home-liver-test#what-is-it

they are way too expensive for me to do
I also struggled just getting the blood drawn for the viome thing I took.  I have a before, so I can hopefully do an after
I took viome and psomagen gut test (They bought ubiome's patents) a month or two ago, and hope to do one again afterward to show that my gut shifted.

I spent the last few months looking at antibiotic herbs and its why I made that honey garlic. I can use that, and bunch of red wine to clear my intestinal tract and then go on a fast. The wine will boost ketone levels and the garlic will flow thru my blood attacking the bacteria (if it gets in).  Fasting also works well to fight bacterial infections.

I told the GF, but good point taht I should have a card.

I looked into a bunch of stuff I could get, but they all risk getting in my blood stream (even the ones that aren't supposed to) because of the crohn's issue. I'm taking a lot of care to eat in a way that maximizes my gut barrier, but if something did slip thru, the garlic + red wine seems to be comparable to stuff I could buy.
I do have access to some tho if I need it.

The viome test I took has some cool analysis of my blood. says my metabolic age is 37 despite being 34.  lots of other neat stuff that should get me a pretty impressive showing of a 
 shift if it does anything.
https://keybase.pub/Gut%20Test/Sampled%20September%2026/
direct link to pdf https://ultimape.keybase.pub/Gut%20Test/Sampled%20September%2026/Viome/ViomeRecommendations_F9AEC9229484.pdf
most of it says "not optimal", which sounds about right
the biological age on page 35 is the main one I am expecting to shift as I suspect the gut bacteria will  fix mTOR, IGF-1, Sirtuins, and AMPK. Its fun how they test for that

yeah, i'm happy about TMA. that means my heart is probably going to be ok
TMA => TMAO is gut bacteria driven AFAICT. I have been focusing on butyrate, so it makes sense that it would be alright.
I also took a psomagen gut test, but it was more just a second datapoint to confirm that my gut bacteria actually shifted.
they bought ubiome's patents afaict

took a week to recover from my hurting my back at dads.  last time It took 2.5+ to get my head on straight, so that is nice.
so not exactly perfect muscle function, but quick recovery is good because it means I can afford to risk exercising, which was one of my hopes.

I also haven't done anything to tweak my diet from normal, so I suspect I'll be doing really good once I focus on doing real keto
i used to only have clear nose only when doing keto, so that it's clear right now without it is also an improvement from baseline.
no crohn's issues really to speak of either after hurting my back. normally muscle damage  = inflammation that triggers a crohn's flair.
so I think thats a good sign it's helping my gut.  This dog shit thing was actually made to treat a form of dog diarrheia, so its not unexpected. But I wasn't confident it would work so well.

I have made some significant progress on getting a way to write and publish documents on my own website using git + jekyll.

I still have to clean it up a bit more with some features that are missing, but this should soon be available on my wovensoup domain.

I just published a longform essay to see what the Virtual Assistant can find that might help with the stuff I face.
https://ultimape.github.io/garden/weeds/write-drafts/longform/virtual-assistant-needs

This feels pretty significant for me given how unproductive I'd been the past year or so.

I thought I was done with the pills, but when I went to dump out the bottle I found an extra one.

Realized after the fact that 30 days * 1.5 hour drift meant I had lost a day somewhere, lol.
I taste tested it since it was supposed to be the last one.

It is vaguely like a mix between a calcium pill ground up, a B-vitamin Complex, and Bile.

I did confirm that when in low concentrations it does in fact smell like flowers.

You probably need to do a 3rd test a month from now to see if the change was stable.

I just realized I have a device that could have been help for measuring neuralogical changes.
I have an EEG system.

I could have loaned it to you.

I don't wanna bust ass right now until I get the second Viome sample. But after I do I'm gonna be spending time actually cleaning my space. It's all a big pile from not being able to lift things. It took me 6 hours just to make sure I had space to keep my measurement tools together.

Huge difference from before
Yeah the weather is worse! But I stopped feeling cold from it. I'm happy about that
