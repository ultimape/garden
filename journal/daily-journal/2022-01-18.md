I spoke with my old boss and it seems there was a mixup, so I guess I get some severance pay.
Still fighting with the breadcrumbs system. No being familiar with ruby / liquid has made this a bit harder than I hoped.
I set up some more plugins. One of them is called [[GitDoc]] which should enable automatically committing markdown files upon saving. This will make it easy to keep my knowlege database in sync.
It doesn't seem to be working tho.
