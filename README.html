<!--
this file exists as a hacky workaround for a logic bug in how GHpages handles indexes.
When README.md is processed and output as the index.html, markdown links to it don't update.
Instead they are simply pointed to a nonexistant README.html file. By creating this 
dummyfile wit a redirect, all those links no longer break. So now we can point markdown links
to the readme.md file properly with Foam and it will just work.
