# Dogshit fixes mTOR, where's the proof?

> Where's the stuff on how dog FMT specifically is beneficial in how it affects mTOR?

It doesn't exist. I am the first person to try it and show a change. N-of-1. 

There is nothing directly about it impacting mTOR cuz I basically have guessed that and used the Viome gut+blood test to show I was right.
A while back I did a gut cleanse and fast that cured my treatment resistant major depression. And I gained grip strength a bit as a result.

So I have spent basically most of 2018-2021 trying to figure out why that worked and what it was doing to fix my autism meltdowns.
It was mTOR.

[New perspectives on the involvement of mTOR in depression as well as in the action of antidepressant drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5061805/)

I also figured out this should be happening before they published because I've gone deep into the genetics that impact Neural Regeneration in my explorations around autism. 

[mTOR-related synaptic pathology causes autism spectrum disorder-associated functional hyperconnectivity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26131-z)

I basically have rethought the entirety of this space and decided autism is just childhood Alzheimer's disease and fingered the gut as the driver of lipid function and oxidative stress. So to fix autism, I have to reverse "aging". And so I technically got younger.

Modern models of disease focusing on pharmacological methods to treat mTOR are not looking at the right space nor treating the actual driver of mTOR's dysfunction.
My goal in life is to prove that age related disease is dysfunctional human hibernation driven by western medical science's myopia and shit food standard + wide spread poisoning of our gut.

And I'm probably right.

This is Nobel prize worthy material. But I was also [willing to die trying it](https://twitter.com/ultimape/status/1524438251205201920). So here be dragons.

I don't even want the prize, I just think it's funny to tell the entirety of the western medical system to eat shit...

There's a 180 year long distortion in how we treat disease in the west and perhaps an even longer history of idiotic use of pharmacology that stems from the "invention" of laudanum back in the 1600. Westerners ripping off ancient medical cures that are actually manipulating the microbiome, bit we have been blind to the mechanisms until a few years ago.

150 years of western propaganda around soap ads have lead to wide scale destruction of the microbiome. And we think we are a pinnacle of modern medical science cuz one guy accidentally figured out how to make penicillin. 

I found a 1000 year old medical potion in a grimoire that they tested to be more effective against MRSA than any of our modern drugs. We are dunces thinking we are geniuses.

It's absurd.

And it's not something's not our medical and scientific institution are willing to pay scientific research for. We are lucky to have what little research we do on it.

I don't care about advancing science or publishing things. I want to heal people.
I figure that will be its own reward. And also that I'll be killed in the process cuz of how many billions are flowing around for a thing that the Ancient Sumerians figured out could be cured by dog feces.

Its cheap for an FMT.
