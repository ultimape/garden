# About: "/long-replies"

This directory contains [[ultimape]]'s long replies. I capture my side of interesting commentary I write in response to people asking me questions and talking to them about topics I care about. They are like seeds to more deeply written essays, but often do not contain as many links or references as I would like, and by their nature often take on an informal tone and will lack context.
