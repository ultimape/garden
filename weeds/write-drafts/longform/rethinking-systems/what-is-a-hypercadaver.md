# What is a HyperCadaver?

Musings on Epicyclic Autocarnivory.

(a collection of tweets turned into a larger narrative)

Darkness haunts my thoughts like the Titan Cronus eating his own children.

Like a snake eating it's own tail to heal it self.

Or a hamster devouring it's sons & daughters to try to avoid starvation long enough to survive until better times.

Tadpoles eating each other forever in a loop.

Adult frogs hopping away to find more pools of water to begin the cycle again.

Life feeds on life.

This is necessary?
Systems feed on systems feed on........
Why did everything always have to keep changing like this.

They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!" Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you, Jesus"

Going to go piss on frogs; the death of my fat cells turning into urea to bring more algae to the pond so that they might not cannibalize each other as much.

This will make more frogs. Such is the nature of suffering.

Cannibalism really isn't that rare in nature when you get down to it. We don't really think much of it, but the entire life cycle of frogs basically depends on tadpoles cannibalizing each other.

if you stare at it long enough: tadpoles are a dispersed body, with cells all competing to absorb nutrients within a small pool of water.

Heck, gut bacteria are just constantly eating each other, with cells competing to absorb nutrients within a small pool of water...

It seems if rabbits can eat insects, is b/c of gut bacteria.

I was exploring herd immunity in ants before it was cool.

Watching our entire collective societies meltdown over this topic is absolutely maddening.

I want to make my own in a DIY bio lab to test a theory that viralphages and bacteria cooperating can do a better job than vaccines since they can be transferred from host to host among a population of mice. Do don't talk to me about herd immunity.

Ya'll, using shame mechanisms is just creating culture divides.

Seeds of doubt from lived experience makes appeals to authority fall flat. Then you got this subculture of ridicule that really only serves to drive more animosity here. All this does is erode trust in the medical establishment further.

But don't let me rain on your hate parade. I hate everything. So I'm going to go look up cannibalism among sheep.

A meta-play: if you end up getting shamed for it but understand herd-immunity. Don't say anything. Pretend that you are outraged. You can use the unfair vitriol levied against as a costly signal to the anti-v*x community, thus able to spread ideas meaningfully.

Trojan Horse.

I got a bad case of politics right now.

I think way too much about ant puke networks and bee boops and how it is basically insect politics.

What if the only thing holding these mutualistic hierarchies in check is a sort of balancing effect between powers? It's a scary thought.

[Infectious Selflessness: How an Ant Colony Becomes a Social Immune System](https://scientificamerican.com/article/ants-social-immune-system/)

Did you know that many ant species "don't age"?  Its neat because their immune system is effectively a collaboration with fungus and gut bacteria. Similar processes happen in Metazoa.

The more eusocial the ant species the more this anti-aging effect seems to occur. I suspect it's because the more they operate with shared-stomachs and collective immune systems, the less their body actually matters. They act more like body cells committing apoptosis when sick.

I think about this a lot.

Talk to me about herd immunity so I can inject memes about cannibalism into your head and keep you up at night. Then you can know what non-24-hour disorder feels like.

Being resistant to prions also means you can infect others with them if they try to eat you.

Right now I am so annoyed but the public discourse that I literally find more joy learning about ungulate cannibalism norms than I do reading my timeline.

For the record, the reason why I research cannibalism is to solve prion disease, and in the process I hope to learn how prevent humans from eating each other like Morlocks.

I might be able to affect that.

I think, perhaps too much, about feeding hamsters serotonin precursors and seeing if it affects cannibalism in a dose dependent way.

Some of the most influential philosophers made their mark on western thought by talking about cannibal semen and the nature of resurrection.

Remember when I figured out that hamsters were getting pellagra and it was driving them to cannibalize their young despite sufficient food supply? Serotonin production is really important.

"Our study provides an unprecedented understanding of how the intestinal microbiota can disrupt maternal behavior and how this can negatively impact development of an offspring  [...]  Early findings suggest the bacteria might be affecting levels of serotonin, the hormone associated with feelings of happiness and well-being, but more work is needed."

I've been researching cannibalism among small rodents because of the strange assumption that it's about lack of food and water. That assumption seems full of holes.

It looks like there's two big reasons why rodents will cannibalize each other. One is by eating too much grain. it seems to predispose them toward cannibalism in much the same way as how locust end up forming as a results of strange serotonin processes.

The other reason that shows up is from stress like the sound of construction noise. Or cars. 

[Using environmental enrichment and nutritional supplementation to improve breeding success in rodents](https://www.nature.com/articles/laban.1114)

Maybe hamsters in captivity are cannibalistic because we treat them like shit, feed them garbage, kill their gut bacteria, and scare them with lights and sound.

My brain is eating itself. My nerves are decaying as my body tries to reap cholesterol to feed itself to fight an inflammatatory disorder. Of course I'm researching cannibalism across all scales of the universe.

An elephant never forgets, they simply misplace the memetic trigger that reminds themselves of an entire web of ideas; until the fear conditioning brings it it back and the bacteria and immune cells team up and then try to kill you and eat your brain.

it might be a histamine thing - but acting indirectly. If the more gelatinized food is consumed quickly in the small intestine, bacteria will produce more byproducts. The body reacts to it by upping insulin and trying to tell the little fucks to calm down.

I can't find the presentation I watched (came out earlier this year), but here's a science pub talking about the issue of gelatinization and the effect on blood sugar / insulin in oats. [An Examination of the Possibility of Lowering the Glycemic Index of Oat and Barley Flakes by Minimal Processing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022316622141659)

What kind of oatmeal? I've learned recently that the way oatmeal is prepared can make a big difference in how quickly it absorbed / processed in small intestine. Seems to be a mechanical issue - closer to powder, the faster it happens. Seems to be a big aspect of Glycemic index.

There's recent studies on this aspect: [Histamine in diabetes: Is it time to reconsider?](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27343700) - but I haven't dug in enough on my own to claim any confidence. But been researching mast cells and they react to histamine and serotonin. [The Multifaceted Mast Cell in Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428674/) I suspect part of some complex regulatory thing.

Was reading about stuff previously in my studies to remove my own brain fog issues. There are some complex thing going on in the brain as a reaction of Histamine and other monoamines (serotonin, dopamine, etc.) [Interaction Between Brain Histamine and Serotonin, Norepinephrine, and Dopamine Systems: In Vivo Microdialysis and Electrophysiology Study
](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12031-015-0536-3) but haven't found much in terms of behavior.

Black pepper has bunch of fun stuff in it. Apparently have types of terpenes are similar to that found in cannabis, cloves, and certain kinds of cinnamon. It and play a role in serotonin regulation. Terpenes are how plants communicate with bacteria...

What does language smell like?

[Terpenes: The Most Common Language in the World(youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PlhcI8O1NY)

I found in my 23andMe's results mutations associated with crohn's disease, specifically around how my body's intestinal wall is formed. I also found stuff related to serotonin/smooth muscle contractions.

The smooth muscle contraction issue is really fascinating because it fits my digestion issues - chronic constipation, nausea, and stomach pain while growing up. Fiber never fixed it. It was serotonin related.

Why might that be related? Many blood vessels use this special kind of smooth muscle regulation, specifically those in the brain

['Second brain' neurons keep colon moving](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-05-brain-neurons-colon.html)

This fact has a lot of interesting implications.

So it is possible you have a similar condition associated w/ serotonin regulation, or with smooth muscle control mechanisms. Notably, the bacteria pumping out serotonin would effectively enhance any oatmeal associated glycemic index effects while also messing with the brain.

Serotonin toxicity can cause some people to go into murderous rages, depending on gene mutations associated with liver metabolism.

You might be thinking, "but if the bacteria in the small intestine produce serotonin, wouldn't that mean the smooth muscles would have enough?" <- Wondered this my self. It turns out serotonin removal in liver can be on a hair pin trigger and for some (me) it is super powered.

So to wrap it up: 
oatmeal/black pepper ->
 glycemic index effects / serotonin bacteria ->
body reacts to threat w/ histamine + serotonin removal system in liver ->
overreaction lowers bloodflow + histamine modulation of brain chemicals -> brain fog

the bacteria that produce serotonin would love this because it slows the colonic propulsion effect which lets them get their fill.

The bacteria are constantly trying to eat you. Eat them before they win. Grow a garden in your stomach.
