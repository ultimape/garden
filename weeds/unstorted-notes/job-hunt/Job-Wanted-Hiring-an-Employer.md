# Job Wanted: Hiring an Employer

## I want to thrive. I want an environment where I can thrive.

A bunch of notes on the kind of environment I think I could thrive working within.

_AKA, oh god, why do all my jobs suck?_

_AKA, please god, let them be agile._

_AKA, don't tell me what to, just get out of the way._

new sections: How I'm awesome and how I'm not, and why you should hire me.

This is my attempt at describing what I want out of my career and ways that Systems & Software fit my expectations and can improve toward these ends.

Welcome to [The Office of the Future](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/01/the-office-of-the-future/).

I don't want to be stuck in a job where my work output plummets because I am not being challenged or inspired (or worse am punished for taking initiative).

I don't want to work at a place where my peers genuinely don't care about what we are doing and the collective mindset is one of 'meh'.

I don't want to be in a situation where I solve a systemic issue with the product, and told that I shouldn't rock the boat by fixing it (as I would stepping on some else's code an it would make them look bad for their next promotion).

I don't want to work at a place that spends most of the time putting out fires because they don't have the self-awareness or drive to realize that half of them they could have prevented.

I don't want to work at a place that lacks empathy and design sense, because I am not comfortable with releasing a product that does nothing but frustrate and inconvenience end users.

Most of all, I don't want an asshole of a boss beating my fellow employees into the ground, creating an environment where I don't feel safe to voice concerns. I hate that I ended up taking out that stress on my friends and loved ones.

I don't want to hate my job.

- Training is not an ad-hoc after thought,
  - and the process is clearly explained
  - expectations are laid out so the new employee isn't left with a mountain of uncertainty.
- Timesheet Hell
- Hours
  - Butt in Seat
  - Addressing lack of engagement by policing Facebook and cracking down on time entries vs investigating and alleviating impediments and annoyances and trying to work on real engagement.

### Uncategorized Concerns

- pride of workmanship
- pride of my work
- have fun
- see a problem solve a problem
- I AM THE MOST able to see problems affecting my workflow, let me fix them. Get out of my way. Fuck you.
- Customer Focused:
  - I don't care about your revenue, I want to make people happy.
  - Revenue goals should only matter enough to keep everyone employed. beyond that its a boat anchor. Its a means to an end.
  - Fuck the shareholders, __I am not working for them.__ I am not working for the managers.  I choose to work here. The share holders do not "allow me" to work her. They do not keep me employed, because they are not the ones generating our money.
    - I am working for my customers:
    - people buying what we make.
    - Future buyers of what we make.
    - My peers who have to use what I make,
    - and my future self.
    - So fuck you.
- I don't care about your metrics, I want to produce things that are useful. It doesn't matter how many tickets I complete, my velocity is for my own benefit to improve. So fuck you.
- I don't care about your legacy systems and cultural inertia. I want to improve things (so get out of my way).
- Workmanship Pride: I don't care if a customer hasn't complained, I want to fix it anyway. I don't want to file it away into the bug stack of things that will never be fixed because nobody cares.  I care. so fuck you.

> 'Imagine our software delivery engine as a high-powered jet engine in a fighter aircraft. What if we fail to perform adequate maintenance on that engine—it gets gunked up. What if we don’t periodically re-build parts of the engine? In software delivery we gum up the engine by: ignoring technical debt, delaying refactorings, disregarding automated testing, under-investing in continuous integration tools and processes, and in accepting long deployment cycles. These things are often considered “technical niceties” rather than keeping the engine running at optimum capacity.'
