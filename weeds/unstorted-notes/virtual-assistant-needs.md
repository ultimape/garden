# Do Virtual Assistants help with Disability issues?

If so, how might they be able to help me function better?

(This draft is a Work in progress and under heaving editing as of 2022-02-04)

----

A friend recommended looking into trying to get help with issues I face, possibly via a Virtual Assistant. I thought it was a good idea, so I began to explore options. This document is my attempt at summarizing my needs to help figure out if this is the right thing for me. I also started a twitter thread on the topic.

The original tweet is here:

> Does anyone have experience with using virtual assistants to help with adhd/autism difficulties and other disability issues?
>
> Not like Siri or google home, but like for-pay people who help you with things? This is hard to research.
>
> I need help. I don't know how to get it.

(There were some more details in that thread but I'm going to be detailing them below so don't feel like you need to read it. More copying here for my future reference.)

## Getting Responses

It turns out asking on Twitter was a great way to start trying to figure this out. I wasn't expecting it, but a couple people already reached out to me! It seems just writing "Virtual Assistant" on twitter ends up getting attention from people looking to help with that. I normally don't like that sort of thing, but in this case I found it a pleasant surprise.

So far the main questions I've received have been something to the effect of:

> Could you go into more detail about **the challenges you're facing**

More specifically:

> What you meant by "adhd/autism difficulties and other disability issues"?

and a more generic

> What kind of help were you looking for?

## Challenges I'm Facing

I've been joking about how I am basically the ["Absent Minded Professor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absent-minded_professor) trope. 

I don't exactly have a good grasp of what kinds of things I need help with. I think if I had a better sense of that, I wouldn't be in the kind of situation I'm in right now. The best thing I can do is explain the issues I run into and the challenges it presents.

The past few days I've putting some thought into it and I think I've made progress. It helped to break things down into major sections with notes about how they effect me, what I know works so far, and thoughts on what might help.

Content Warning: This goes a little deep into my issues and might be a bit upsetting to read. I figure this comes with the nature of asking for help. Please don't interpret it as me whining or complaining. I'm not aiming to write up a sob story or get sympathy. I'm simply trying to be clear on my needs as best I can.

Also, don't feel like you need to read everything I link to. I try to provide references to ideas and links to papers for context, and for people who are curious, but the aren't necessary to read for general understanding. This is a habit I've picked up because of my communication challenges, so don't worry if you don't have time for them.

### 1. Executive Functioning

#### Overview

I have some kind of executive function disorder. It is a thing commonly associated with ADHD. I'm diagnosed as autistic and it seems there is [an overlap with these traits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_dysfunction#Autism_spectrum_disorder).

It's not so much that I can't plan out my tasks, but that sometimes I just can't seem to focus on them. I know what is a high priority, but often what I do in the moment isn't always the best thing I should be doing. And trying to force myself into working on it ends up not being effective. It's like my brain shuts down and it's nothing but stress.

And its not just ignoring something simple here and there. I'll literally put off important activities in my life that I need to do to stay alive. More times than I'm willing to admit I'll put off laundry or avoid taking a shower.

To be fair, many of these are challenges for other reasons. Sometimes its because I physically can't stand well so doing it for a for a long time in the shower is hard. Or carrying heavy things up and down the stairs to the washing machine ends up being difficult.

On many days I'm happy to get out of bed, get dressed, and do something productive on the computer. The only thing I can reliably do is go to the bathroom, even if I have to lean against the wall thru the hall way. So avoiding important tasks even when I can do these things, means I can't be as effective as I should be.

For example, this past week I've had 4 different important tasks I should be doing (one of them writing this document), but yesterday I spent 4 hours making a weird how-to video about a no-bake prebiotic cookies. This was good because it helped me see if I was up for doing a physical task (thus testing a health experiment). And I ended up with a few days of healthy breakfasts I wont have to worry about... But it wasn't at all what I had planned on working on that night. It was spur of the moment and while fun, not really the best use of my time.

Why I felt the need to make a video of it? I have no idea. My excuse is that it made it fun and interesting so I could finish making cookies, but it seems silly in retrospect. Sometimes my life seems to be just a series of chaotic activities like that with long spans of doing nothing in between. I'd like to be able to focus on my actual goals more.

#### Successes so far

I've managed to embrace the flighty nature of my attention a bit, turning it into an asset where I can. But it still kind of sucks not being able to guide my focus onto doing things I genuinely want (or need) to do. Even my main marketable skill right now—exploring research and health / biology topics—isn't much different from making that video.

The main expression of this is how I enjoy getting distracted by rabbit-holes around my health interests and writing about it as I go. I even managed to turn that into being employed to do for a year or so! But that phiszzled out due to the pandemic changing the research org's priorities and me not being able to direct my attention better.

Right now the best I've got going for me is working on my motivation levels in general by improving my health & diet. So I do more things overall and can channel that energy toward an eventual goals even it ends up being chaotic in practice. All the structure and routines in the world don't help much if I can't physically get out of the chair I'm sitting in. It does seem to be working, if slowly, but because of the issues I discuss below, it's very hard to maintain momentum.

#### What help here might look like

I do know I find it useful to have people talk to me about what I'm doing or how things have been going. Occasionally a friend of mine (or my GF) will ask me what I'm doing and it will kick me into gear. Something about trying to talk about my goals helps me make them more concrete in my mind and that makes them actionable. I'm not sure why.

I describe this loosely under an umbrella of "being event driven". Sometimes all it takes to remind me I need to eat food is to have my girlfriend walk in to the room and say 'Hi'. This event stops my train of thought long enough and lets me introspect about my state. This is the 'absent minded professor' thing I mentioned earlier. I believe this is happening in a more complex way when taking about my tasks but can't articulate it well. I do know it feels the same.

That effect also helps me write more salient thoughts. Writing stuff for a specific person helps me collecting my random thoughts down into a more cohesive narrative. Sometimes even a really good question is all I need to solidify the weird threads of ideas that float around in my head.

I get the sense that I am more willing to work on something for someone else's sake than my own. E.g. I have no problems motivating myself to take a shower before visiting someone because I know they'd be uncomfortable if I was gross looking. The reason I am even working on this document is because someone is depending on me to finish it. Having reminders that subtly hint at this might help a lot. E.g. another human being asking me "have you followed up with [x] you were going to do for [person]?" might be more effective than just a popup in some task management tool, if only because it will mean I have to think about how to respond to them.

I also am rewarded when I can share what I've accomplished with other people. This is partly why I write so much on twitter and create/collect all the research notes etc. It feels good to me to share what I'm learning because it's something I'm proud of, and at this point I've gotten enough people commenting on how it helps them out with learning on their own that also feel good about helping people.

### 2. Unpredictable Memory Issues

#### Overview

The main thing I run into that ends up being an issue seem to stem from what I believe to be a Multiple Sclerosis related problems, in particular [memory issues](https://www.healthline.com/health/multiple-sclerosis/memory-loss). I get weird ['brain fog'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouding_of_consciousness) and my memory for things will occasionally completely disappear. I will temporarily forget everything and lose track of time. On the outside, this looks like a couple days of scattered thoughts and varying levels of [short term memory loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia).

When this gets to it's most extreme forms the challenges are are in the moment-to-moment. I'll go out to prepare food and begin to grab a plate. Then upon reaching for the plate up I'll realize I'll need to use the bathroom to pee. On the way to the bathroom (while still holding the plate), something will surprise me and I'll forget what I was doing. I'll then be standing in the living room holding a plate, while anxious from needing to pee, while trying to deal with the more immediate surprise. I will eventually have to pee so bad that I will make it to bathroom, set down the plate ("why do I have a plate?") and relieve myself. After cleaning up (washing my hands etc). I'll go back to my room. And not eat and forget the plate and the surprise event entirely.

Insights like this have been super valuable for me in uncovering ties between Multiple Sclerosis and other neurodegenerative disorders. But in the moment they are absolutely awful to deal with.

I am still uncertain if this is Multiple Sclerosis or some kind of [schizophrenia related memory symptom](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/study-finds-brain-marker-poor-memory-schizophrenia-patients). In fact there may be little difference given [the weird overlap in M.S. + schiz etiologies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5578149/). Worse, these very struggles I'm describing make it really hard to jump the medical diagnostic hurdles. I literally haven't seen a doctor since 2015, and before that it was in 2005 to get vaccines to go to college.

#### Successes So Far

The memory issues got really bad for a while when it compounded with motivation loss from Major Depression. I developed a way to deal wit hit and I [wrote a bit about my coping process](https://scribe.rip/scat-sense/clawing-productivity-away-from-the-void-53841451e51f) during that time. But I found even after the depression went away, I was still struggling with the memory issue.

This makes it hard to persist on projects and ideas without a lot structural support. Abstractly, I think about it like how an ant uses pheromones to encode information about their world. I've had success setting up my living environment to facilitate having memory aids and place prompts in my environment to remind me about stuff, but that has been challenging since of some changes in my living situation.

In an ideal world, I'd be allowed to write notes on mirrors and have a stable enough living situation that I could leave written notes next to tasks to remind me why they are there. Given control over my environment, this is something I am able to do on my own and will do. Where I live now I am not able to do this for a myriad of reasons. It's been a struggle.

I've had some luck with keeping a sort of journal with some friends where we remind each other about coping skills and help remind each other about stuff that has worked in the past, but that hasn't been reliable enough for the extend that I run into these issues.

#### What help here might look like

The challenge I face is that I struggle to recover from these setbacks and get moving again. This leads to occasionally long stretches of time where I get stuck in this weird semi-lucid state where I could do things, but don't. This seems to be manageable if I am simply able to remember what it was I wanted to do. Someone who can help to remind me about things that I need to do via something like regular emails, or phone texts might be a way to go.

More directly, I will forget that I have lists of projects and tasks on my plate (or what service I put them in) and so I never start to work on them. This compounds with the executive functioning problems I discussed in the other section.

I don't think a Virtual Assistant can help with these extreme version of this issue. But I think it would be helpful to have someone who can be patient with me while I cope with it and follow up and check in with me to see when I'm back to myself would be valuable. It feels like rebooting of a sort and part of the slowness there is just trying to find everything I misplaced.

### Obsessive Interests

#### Overview

An additional complexity layered onto the Executive Functioning issues and memory trouble, is the autism associated obsessiveness often described as (["restricted interests"](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/the-benefits-of-special-interests-in-autism/)).

While more useful than those other two, given this intensity of interest means I am able to learn and stay productive on a topic, it does also complicates things. It means I'll often get so sucked into an obsession associated project to the point that I completely forget all my other ones, often to the point of neglecting them entirely and never picking them up again. They get pushed out of my focus.

This seems distinct from the memory issue because it's more a result of hyper-focus than some the fugue state, because I still typically have my memories and faculties intact. It is also something that when it does happen is often quite useful overall because of the heightened levels of productivity it brings.

Still, this has lead to overlooking things that are important, like making sure to follow up on long term tasks (or remembering to go shopping). So the net result looks a lot like the problems I run into with memory issues, but the underlying cause is different.

#### Successes So Far

A lot of my life is structured around capturing the output from these states in a way that I can continually build on over time. It has a relationship to the executive function aspects because it's not very predictable or directable, but it usually ends up being on something I've worked on before.

It is also usually something I _do_ want to work on and I don't consider this to be misdirected energy. It tends to be more like a highly-productive flow-state than something that is a chaotic distraction. Much of trying to be successful in focusing on other tasks is because of how much *not doing them* distracts from my effectiveness here. 

#### What help here might look like

This is where adaptivity is essential. Having someone pay attention / ask if my forgetfulness is driven by memory or driven by obsessiveness is important. A reminder tool can't make that decision and so can't choose the best course of action.

I don't have a good sense of how to describe the nuance well here, but I know I specifically *don't* want to have reminders during these states because having all my attention focused on the task at hand is actually good. If I'm hyper-focused on something, want to be able to keep doing that ['deep work'](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013UWFM52/) and take advantage of the intensity while it occurs.

These are some of the most productive states I can be in and I only ever wanna be jostled out of them if a task is extremely urgent and important. Aside from maybe an occasional reminder to plan ahead for making sure I eat and drink and make sure I haven't fall into a memory fugue from the stress of it, this is generally a good thing for me an I wanna facilitate it.

### Non-24-Hour Syndrome

Another complication that I regularly run into is my sleep schedule. No matter how hard I try, I am not able to synchronize my sleep with a 24-hour day cycle.

The challenges this presents to me are myriad. From generally getting higher rates of jet-lagg when I don't stick to my akward schedue, to challenge around waking up for scheduled events

### More estoeric problems

I have a smattering of other terms tha relate to challenges I face. Most of them are at the intersection of M.S. and Schizophrenia, but mostly this is due to how "Negative Symptoms" in Schizophrenia overlap with traits found in Autism.

#### Alogia

> Some people are naturally quiet and don't say much. But if you have a serious mental illness, brain injury, or dementia, talking might be hard. This lack of conversation is called alogia, or “poverty of speech.” Alogia can affect your quality of life.
> [Alogia - WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-alogia)

#### Anhedonia

> Most people understand what pleasure feels like. They expect certain things in life to make them happy. Maybe you enjoy riding your bike, listening to the sounds of the ocean, or holding someone's hand. But some people lose the ability to feel joy. The things that once made them content are no longer fun or enjoyable. That's anhedonia.
> [Anhedonia - WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/depression/what-is-anhedonia)

#### Avolition

> It's normal to drag your feet when you have an annoying chore to do. But if you have "avolition," your habit of putting off a task is on a whole different level.
>
> Avolition is a total lack of motivation that makes it hard to get anything done. You can't start or finish even simple, everyday tasks. Getting off the couch to wash the dishes or drive to the supermarket can feel like climbing Mount Everest.
> [Avolition - WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-avolition)

#### Affective Flattening

> People with ASD interact, behave, and communicate in unusual ways. A flat affect is one of them. Your face often may appear blank. Your voice may not change tone or may sound robot-like. People with ASD also have a hard time reading other people’s voices and body language.
> [Flat Affect - WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/flat-affect)

#### Asociality

> Asociality refers to the lack of motivation to engage in social interaction, or a preference for solitary activities. Asociality may be associated with avolition, but it can, moreover, be a manifestation of limited opportunities for social relations.
> [Asociality - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociality)

### Example of Challenges

It took me almost a year to get the autism diagnosis and it was probably one of the hardest things (in terms of logistics) that I've done in my life. On top of the legwork needed to find out where to get a diagnosis, I also had to deal with getting mail delivered to a new location, There were so many multiple choice questions that my hand cramped up while doing it. I eventually had to have my girlfriend sit with me for hours as she read off the questions because I was struggling so much to even contemplate what they were asking.

### The Challenge This Presents

## So A Virtual Assistant?

A friend suggested trying a virtual assistant for a month who can help follow up with me and adaptively prompt me and deal with the complexities here that doesn't seem to work well for me. They expressed an interest in helping me cover the costs.

I went into some detail in the thread about the challenges I face. In particular the non-24-hour sleep problem. I'm not necessarily looking to solve all of them right now, but would love to figure out ways a virtual assistant might be able to keep me focused and recover from those weird mental fugues.

Right now I am unsure what exactly is available to help me. I've been doing research on the topic but most of what I find are for business assistance and they don't really have a good fit for my needs.

I've been logging things I read that seem useful here https://are.na/ultimape/virtual-assistants-hired-disability-aids but still don't have a good sense of how this would work for someone who's not looking for business assistance.
