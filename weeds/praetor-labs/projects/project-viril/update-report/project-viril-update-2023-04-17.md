## Progress Made

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Settled on modifying the OpenFlexure platform to optimize for semen measurements.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the tools and materials have been acquired aside from sourcing some motors.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survived the winter’s cold despite losing an apartment (per previous report).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to build out Praetor Labs’ mobile base of operations.

## Current Status

Now that it is warm out, we are in the process of building out a 16 ft trailer to house Praetor Labs.

## Obstacles Encountered & Adaptations

### Obstacles:

* The bus was unable to get fixed.
* Norman had to stay up in Burlington at a friend’s to be in contact with the repair people. This made a significant amount of delay in our ability to work with each other.
* The garage did not have sufficient access to get power to our printer/laser cutter despite being told otherwise.
* Were not allowed to place makeshift solar panels on the lawn per the landowner.
* Living situation is not conducive to productive work on computers.
Cold weather made working outside untenable.

### Adaptations:

* Cut losses on the bus.
* Spec’d out what it would take to get the lab space running on a 16ft Trailer.
* Moved Norman to the garage space on a cot at end of March
* Rearranged the entire Garage space to facilitate working together.
* Acquired Trailer (April 6th) and began building it

## Significant Changes

The bus has been replaced with a 16 ft trailer. Plans to work over winter were not viable due to power constraints and the cold weather.
