> (Cuck Fondle Percent)

A meme run inspired by DougDoug getting [shot in the back by Fondle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNsIiFjs-70&t=8m15s).
Modification on the marriage speedrun that involves literally cucking Fondle.

----

1. Get [Fondle as a follower](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Faendal#Follower).
2. Get a house from [Hearthfire](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Hearthfire).
3. Make Fondle your [Steward](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Steward_(Hearthfire)).
4. Kill [Camelia](https://skyrim.fandom.com/wiki/Camilla_Valerius)'s brother so she takes over the shop.
5. Marry Camelia.
    * Requires recovering the claw from Bleak Falls Barrow and then proposing to her.
6. Move Camelia (as your wife) into your Hearthfire house while Fondle is your steward there.
    * This requires getting all the stuff to build the house to have a bed.
7. Sleep in the same bed while Fondle watches.
8. "Divorce" Camelia while Fondle watches.
9. Get a [real follower](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Lydia_(Skyrim)) to carry your burdens.
    * (Style points if you get J'zargo to use his scrolls on Fondle)

Best time is about 4 hours by [BigThumbnail](https://www.twitch.tv/bigthumbnail) using waitskip and item duplication for money, while testing that this was actually possible. (Tho the VOD was lost to history).
