# Garden

Hello. I am [[UltimApe]].

This is a [[Digital-Garden]] to contain my notes.

You can view [live web based version](https://ultimape.github.io/garden/) of it on GitHub pages.

It is intended to act as a data-source to be hosted on [[wovensoup]].

I'm using [[Foam]] to manipulate this repository.

The links are smart enough to work with the raw GitHub repository markdown rendering.

You can start if you wish to navigate it in the raw form, you can start at [[index.md]]
